# Raw (original) data

Include here any original raw data that can't be downloaded directly by the
data preparation code.
Avoid doing this if at all possible.

To minimize the size of the repository, it's usually a good idea to compress
the data files if they aren't already.

Data files were downloaded from https://ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/geodas/trackline.html
by selecting a region from the web interface. Since no direct download link is
provided, they have to be stored here and cannot be downloaded automatically
with Pooch.

Data here are in the [public domain](https://ngdc.noaa.gov/ngdcinfo/privacy.html)
and not subject to copyright protection within the USA.
